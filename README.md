## Description
The project is an ZIO 2 application : a graph data structure library with various operations.

## Structure
The project is divided in 2 parts:
- The core library, in the `core` module
- The application, in the `app` module

The core library has the files:
- `Graph.scala` : the graph data structure

The application has the files:
- `Main.scala` : the main application

## Installation
To run the application, you need to have `sbt` installed on your machine.
1) Clone the repository
2) Go to the root of the project
3) Run `sbt run` to run the application
4) Run `sbt test` to run the tests
5) Go to the `app` module and launch `Main.scala` to run the application

## Design Decisions

We have chosen to create several classes to represent our graphs.

### The Edge Class

**Why**: To represent the edges between the vertices of the graph

**How**:
- **Attributes**:
    - `from`: `Int` representing the vertex where the edge comes from.
    - `to`: `Int` representing the vertex where the edge goes
    - `weight`: `Double` representing the weight of the edge, default value is `Double.NaN`
- **Methods**:
    - No methods
- **Note**:
  - You certainly noticed vertices are represented by Int, so there are no classes for them here. By using a class for edges, we did not need a class for vertices. But, if respecting the SOLID principles was a concern, it would certainly better to have this Vertices class to give him the responsibilities over itself such as the neighbours method which you will see below in the Methods section of the next Class.

### The Graph Class (Abstract)

**Why**: To implement the common behaviors of the concrete graph classes. We have chosen to make it abstract because the main concern of the project was about directed, undirected, and weighted graphs, so instanciate a Graph object would not be usefull.  

**How**:
- **Attributes**:
    - `vertices`: `Set[Int]` to store the vertices of the graph.
    - `edges`: `Set[Edge]` to store the edges of the graph
    - `weighted`: `Boolean` to indicate if the graph uses weights or not
- **Methods**:
    - `addEdge`: `Graph[V]`: Add an edge to the graph
    - `addEdges`: `Graph[V]`: Add multiple edges to the graph
    - `neighbors (abstract)`: `Set[V]`: Get the neighbors of a vertex
    - `copyWith (abstract)`: `Set[V]`: Get the deep copy of the object
    - `removeEdge`: `Graph[V]`: Remove an edge from the graph
    - `removeEdges`: `Graph[V]`: Remove multiple edges from the graph
    - `dfs`: `List[V]`: Perform a Depth-First Search on the graph
    - `bfs`: `List[V]`: Perform a Breadth-First Search on the graph
    - `floydWarshall`: `Either[String, Map[(V, V), Double]]`: Execute the Floyd-Warshall algorithm on the graph
    - `dijkstra`: `Either[String, Map[V, Double]]`: Execute Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph
    - `validateEdges`: `Set[Edge[V]]`: Check if an edge is valid or not

### The UndirectedGraph Class (Extends Graph)

**Why**: To represent an undirected graph

**How**:
- **Attributes**:
    - Same as the `Graph`, but overrides edges to ensure they are valid for an undirected graph
- **Methods**:
    - Implements `neighbors` and `copyWith` from `Graph`

### The DirectedGraph Class (Extends Graph)

**Why**: To represent a directed graph

**How**:
- **Attributes**:
    - Same as the `Graph`, but ensures edges are valid for a directed graph
- **Methods**:
    - Implements `neighbors` and `copyWith` from `Graph`
    - `topologicalSort`: `Either[String, List[V]]`: Compute a topological sorting of the graph
    - `detectCycle`: `Either[String, List[V]]`: Detect if there are cycles in the graph
